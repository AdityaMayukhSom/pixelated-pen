### About Myself

I'm Aditya Mayukh Som, a senior at `Jadavpur University, India`.

My primary languages of choice are `Java` and `JavaScript`, though I've used `Go` and `Python` for many projects as well. I dabbled in `C++` but realized soon that I prefer high-level languages. I've also had the opportunity to use `Ruby` and `Dart` for some smaller projects. Besides, I also enjoy writing `Bash` and `Lua` scripts to automate tasks.

I recently completed my internship as an `Intern Analyst` at `Wells Fargo`, where I built machine learning models for financial analysis. Turns out the ancient art of meeting project deadlines was actually the biggest takeaway.

Last year, I interned at a Singapore based startup `Betr Beta`, helping build their platform for release notes management. Prior to that, I interned at an AI driven startup, `Writee` as a front-end developer, creating their web interface.

Apart from the time spent with my dear laptop, I try to capture the world through my camera lens. I also enjoy playing acoustic guitar, letting music be another form of my creative expression. Additionally, I run a [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@AdityaMayukhSom) where I spill the beans about the secrets of the universe. If that piques your interest, do check it out!
